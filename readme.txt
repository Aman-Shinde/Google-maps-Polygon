Drawing multiple polygons on google maps

Don't forget to replace <YOUR API KEY> with your google maps api key in line number 8 of index.html

In index.html i have used two functions

1)initmap() :- To display map on your browser

2)createPolygon():-  This function accept two parametres, one for the array of coordinates and 
                     second one for the message for the infowindow.
                     Infowindow popup after clicking on polygon.
